# The toki pona programming language

Toki Sinpin is an experimental programming language inspired by the simplicity
and minimalist philosophy of Toki Pona. It aims to create a unique coding
experience through "code poems," where programs can be written in a concise,
expressive, and poetic manner. Goals

- Code Poems: Toki Sinpin encourages writing code that resembles poetic
  expressions, allowing programmers to explore the creative aspects of coding.
- Modern Features: The language incorporates modern programming features such
  as dynamic dispatch and coroutines, inspired by languages like Golang,
  enabling developers to write efficient and concurrent code.
- Python Bytecode Target: Toki Sinpin compiles to Python bytecode, enabling
  seamless interop with existing Python code and libraries.
- Rust Implementation: The language is implemented in Rust, leveraging its
  performance, safety, and ecosystem.
- REPL: Toki Sinpin provides a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for an interactive
  coding experience, allowing developers to experiment and iterate quickly.
- Natural Language Processing: The language explores the boundaries between
  formal grammars and natural language processing, creating a unique
  programming paradigm that embraces linguistic concepts.

## Fantasy snippets

1. **Variables and types**: use the word "li" (is, are) to declare variables.
   The type of the variable can be inferred from the context
```
suno li suli.
```

2. **Control flow**: use "la" (if, when) for conditionals, and "tawa" (to, for)
   for loops.
```
la suno li suli:
    toki e "suno li suli!"

tawa jan li luka:
    toki e jan.
```

3. **Functions**: use "pali" (do, work, function) to define functions. To call
   a function, we'll just use the function's name followed by its arguments.
``` pali pona(a, b): pana e a + b.

pona(5, 7).
```

4. **Concurrency**: use "kama" (come, happen, cause) to start a new thread or process.
```
kama pali pona.
```

5. **Modules and Namespaces**: use "ma" (land, country, region) to define a module or namespace.


6. kama (come, happen, cause): Besides coroutines, kama can be used to denote
   control flow statements or conditional execution. For example, kama pali
   (come to work) could be used as a function-like construct to define a block
   of code that executes when a certain condition is met.

7. ilo (tool, device): ilo can be used to represent classes or objects in an
   object-oriented programming paradigm. It can encapsulate data and behavior
   within a single entity.

8. pali (do, work, function): In addition to representing functions, pali can
   be used for defining operations or actions within the language. It can serve
   as a versatile keyword for various programming constructs.

9. suno (sun, light): suno can be associated with visibility modifiers or
   access control. It can determine the visibility or accessibility of certain
   code elements within the program.

10. telo (water, liquid): telo can be used for handling I/O operations or data
    streams, such as reading from or writing to files or network sockets.

11. kasi (plant): kasi can be used for representing data structures or
    collections, like arrays, lists, or trees.

12. ko (semi-solid or squishy substance): ko can be associated with memory
    management or storage-related operations, such as allocating or
    deallocating memory.

13. pimeja (darkness, blackness): pimeja can be utilized for representing error
    handling mechanisms or exception handling, where errors or exceptional
    situations are dealt with.

14. walo (lightness, whiteness): walo can be paired with code formatting or
    code style conventions. It can be used to enforce or define rules for
    consistent and readable code.
